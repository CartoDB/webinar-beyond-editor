- show how much info is present on OSM using osm.org: look for a metro station
- grab metro stations from Overpass Turbo (railway = station), as GeoJSON
- go back to osm.org and go up to the route relation
- grab metro lines from Overpass Turbo (route=subway), as GeoJSON
- put both datasets on an Editor map
- extract colors data from the OSM, using SQL
- show how we could style metro line colors with CartoCSS, and why we need a smarter way to do that
- build barebones html/JS app, with the yeoman generator and an existing viz.json
- have a glance at how the viz.json file generated by the editor is structured
- poke these layers with a bit of JS
- programmatically change stations layer CartoCSS
- use the SQL client embedded in cartodb.js to fetch some SQL on the lines layer
- use some generated Carto CSS to actually use those colors
- hide/show stations with wheelchair access by tweaking SQL on the stations layer- make this dynamic by using an Underscore template
- have a look at the metro traffic data
- import trafic csv, using a simple node script and the SQL API
- get back to the editor to see the resulting table
- with a simple SQL join, preview how we could see trafic data by station
- precompute an SQL column, and use this column in the CartoCSS, to show trafic data using circle size
- build some basic interactivity on the web app
